## Eleso Font Glyphs Demo

Open **demo.html** to view a comprehensive list of all the glyphs available in your font, along with their corresponding codes and ligatures.

### Using the Font

To utilize the generated TTF font in desktop applications, simply install the font file. To copy the character associated with each icon, refer to the text box located in the bottom right corner of each glyph in **demo.html**. Please note that the character inside this text box may be invisible, but it can still be copied. For further guidance, check out this [IcoMoon documentation on local fonts](https://icomoon.io/#docs/local-fonts).

### Important Notes

- The files in the **demo-files** directory are not required for integrating the generated font into your projects.
- You can easily import **selection.json** back into the IcoMoon app using the **Import Icons** button or by navigating to **Main Menu â†’ Manage Projects** to retrieve your selected icons.
